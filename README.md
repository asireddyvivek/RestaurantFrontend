# RestaurantFrontend

I have built this website to implement the basic knowledge I have on web technologies.

This website is built using hTML5, CSS3 and Javascript.

You can have a clear understanding of how this website actually works by clicking on the following link : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YFhV25Df7UtpzU6JdWoEsAD0D1YyWzlL/view

I have hosted this site on github pages and you can access it on -> https://asireddyvivek.github.io/RestaurantFrontend/

I suggest to view this website at a zoom out of 90% if you are using chrome.
